# CSS Layout Demo

## Overview

A simple ExpressJS app (hosted [here](https://css-layout-showcase.herokuapp.com/)) to showcase some of the modern CSS 3 layout features. 
One of the trends in the latest developments in CSS is to achieve responsive designs with minimal use of media queries, which is the focus 
of this showcase. 

This was inspired by a talk given by Justin Slack at [DevConf 2020](https://www.devconf.co.za/) titled 
"Farewell Bootstrap (and other tales from the new CSS layout)".

This application may serve as a small cookbook of some common CSS layout techniques.

## Running the application

Ensure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. 

First restore the packages:

```npm install```

Then start the web server:

```npm start```

The application will be hosted at `http://localhost:3000/`.
