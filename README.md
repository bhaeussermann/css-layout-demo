# CSS Layout Demo

A simple ExpressJS app to showcase some of the modern CSS 3 layout features.

It was inspired by a talk given by Justin Slack at [DevConf 2020](https://www.devconf.co.za/) titled 
"Farewell Bootstrap and other tales from the new CSS layout".

This application may serve as a small cookbook of some common CSS layout techniques.
