<p>The <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media directive allows to set alternative colours for elements based on whether the user has his
operating system / browser set to dark mode or light mode.</p>

<p>First, add the &ldquo;color-scheme&rdquo; meta tag to your page's header to tell the browser that the page supports both the light and dark
colour schemes:</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta name=&quot;color-scheme&quot; content=&quot;light dark&quot;&gt;
</pre>

<p>This will apply the default background and text colours of the applicable colour scheme (even before the CSS is loaded).</p>

<p>Here's a simple example of using the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media directive that sets the text colour based on the current
colour scheme preference:</p>

<pre>
body {
  color: black;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    color: #D0D0D0;
  }
}
</pre>

A more maintainable way of setting different colours for different elements is by assigning the colours to CSS variables based on the user's
preference and referencing the variables in the relevant CSS rules:

<pre>
:root {
  --text-color: black;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --text-color: #D0D0D0;
  }
}

body {
  color: var(--text-color);
}
</pre>
